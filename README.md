The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive financial dashboard 
utilizing Tableau. The focus is on showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) that specifically address riskweighted assets (RWA), credit risk, and market risk.
The "Financial Insights Dashboard Report" details the creation of a dynamic Tableau dashboard aimed at 
providing decision-makers with a clear overview of key financial metrics. The report outlines the comprehensive 
scope of the project, focusing on risk-weighted assets (RWA), credit risk, and market risk indicators. Utilizing 
Tableau's capabilities, the dashboard distills complex financial data into easily understandable insights, fostering 
a user-centric approach. The inclusion of tabs like RWA Overview, Credit Risk RWA, and Market Risk RWA 
facilitates seamless navigation. Additionally, specific KPIs such as Credit Risk Drivers and Market Risk Drivers 
offer detailed analyses of factors influencing risk variations. The dashboard, designed with simplicity and clarity 
in mind, enhances financial transparency and aids in strategic decision-making. The project's long-term impact 
lies in its adaptability to changing financial landscapes and regulatory dynamics, ensuring enduring value for the 
organization.
